        <P>Place 3 pieces.

        <P>Click on one of them to expand.

        <P>The piece expands in 4 directions.
        <img src="step3.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:675px;height:403px">
        <P>Now let us repeat.
        <img src="step4.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:675px;height:403px">
        <P>One more time and the piece will expand.
        <img src="step5.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:675px;height:403px">
        <P>Now it overflows taking the opponents pieces. That's it.

		<P>As you see, the board is divided in <em>8x8</em> cells. Each cell may contain a piece of
		size one, two or three. Initially each player has <em>two size three pieces</em>.
		<P>The players take turns to select one of their own pieces to be increased one in size.
		If a size three piece is selected, it will <em>"overflow"</em>, which means that it will be split
		into four small pieces, which are then distributed to the neighbor cells (left, right,
		up, down). If a neighbor is also a size three piece, it will also "overflow". Thus you
		can get rather long chain reactions.
		<P>The opponents pieces can only be won by "overfloving" your own pieces into them.
		If one of your pieces is distributed to a cell occupied by one of the opponent's
		pieces, that piece changes color and is increased by one in size. That way you can win
		an entire chain of the opponent's pieces in one move, if you play wisely.
		<P>Pieces that falls off the edge of the board are lost. Don't worry too much about this
		though, the game is not about having many pieces, just about having ALL the pieces ;-)
		<P>The game is won by the player who captures <em>all the pieces on the board</em>.
		<P>Although the rules are very simple, the game is not at all easy to play. There are a
		lot of tips and tricks to learn. A good way to learn some of them, is to use the hint
		function and then try to figure out the reasoning behind the tips you get.
		<P> -->
